/*
Imagine you have a movie collection, 
and you want to write code that returns
your review for each one. Here are the movies and your reviews:

"Toy Story 2" - "Great story. Mean prospector."
"Finding Nemo" - "Cool animation, and funny turtles."
"The Lion King" - "Great songs."

Write a function named 
getReview that takes in a movie
name and returns its review based
on the information above.
If given a movie name not 
found just return "I don't know!". 
Use a structure learned in
an earlier lesson (NOT if/else statements)
to write this function.

*/
var getReview = function (movie) {
    switch(movie){
        case "Toy Story 2":
            return "Great story. Mean prospector.";
            break;
        case 'Finding Nemo':
            return  "Cool animation, and funny turtles."
            break;
        case 'The Lion King':
            return "Great songs."
            break;
        default:
            return "I don't know!";
            break;
    }
};

getReview("The Lion King");
