/*
Alright, it's time to learn the basics of object-oriented programming!
Often abbreviated OOP, this is a very important programming paradigm that is widely used in the industry today.

Let's start by introducing classes. We learned in the last course that constructors are a way to make objects,
but they actually do even more than that.

When you make a constructor, you are in fact defining a new class.
A class can be thought of as a type, or a category of objectsâ€”kind 
of like how Number and String are types in JavaScript.

Take a look at our Person example taken from Introduction to Objects I.
In this case bob and susan are two separate objects, but both belong to the class Person.

*/

function Person(name,age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

// Let's make bob again, using our constructor
var bob = new Person("Bob Smith", 30);
var susan = new Person("Susan Jordan", 35);

// make your own class here

function Circle(radius){
    this.radius = radius;
}

var a = new Circle (4);
console.log(typeof(a));

console.log(bob);
console.log(susan);
